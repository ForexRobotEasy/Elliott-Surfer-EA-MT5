## Product Description

The Elliott Surfer EA MT5 is an expert advisor designed to automatically trade the forex market using the Elliott Wave theory. It is developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team and is based on a reliable forex strategy.

The expert advisor uses input parameters to determine the trading conditions. These parameters can be customized by the user according to their trading preferences. The input parameters include:

- `lotSize`: Initial lot size for trading
- `riskPercentage`: Risk percentage per trade
- `stopLossPips`: Stop loss in pips
- `takeProfitPips`: Take profit in pips
- `maxTrades`: Maximum number of trades

The expert advisor works by continuously monitoring the market for trade opportunities. It checks if a trade is open and if it has reached the take profit or stop loss level. If a trade is open and reaches the take profit level, the trade is closed. If it reaches the stop loss level, the trade is also closed. If no trade is open, the expert advisor checks for entry points on corrective waves based on the Elliott Wave theory. If an entry point is found, a new trade is opened.
